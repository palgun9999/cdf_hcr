## Problem

### Best of Two

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Each player rolls a standard six-sided die three times. The score of a player is calculated as the sum of the two highest rolls. The player with the higher score wins. If both players have the same score, the game ends in a tie.

Determine the winner of the game or if it is a tie.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case contains six space-separated integers $A_1$, $A_2$, $A_3$, $B_1$, $B_2$ and $B_3$ — the values Alice gets in her $3$ dice rolls, followed by the values which Bob gets in his $3$ dice rolls.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line `Alice` if Alice wins, `Bob` if Bob wins and `Tie` in case of a tie.

Note that you may print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings `tie`, `TIE`, `Tie`, and `tIe` are considered identical.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^4$
- $1 \leq A_1, A_2, A_3, B_1, B_2, B_3 \leq 6$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
3 2 5 6 1 1
4 4 5 6 4 1
6 6 6 6 6 1

```

```
Alice
Bob
Tie
```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case $1$:**  Alice's score is $8 = (3 + 5)$ which is greater than Bob's score $7 = (6 + 1)$.

 **Test Case $2$:**  Alice's score is $9 = (5 + 4)$ which is less than Bob's score $10 = (6 + 4)$.

 **Test Case $3$:**  Alice's score is $12 = (6 + 6)$ which is same as Bob's score $12 = (6 + 6)$.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() 
{
    int t;
    cin>>t;
    while(t--)
    {
        int a1,a2,a3,b1,b2,b3;
        cin>>a1>>a2>>a3>>b1>>b2>>b3;
        int alice=a1+a2+a3-min({a1,a2,a3});
        int bob=b1+b2+b3-min({b1,b2,b3});
        if(alice==bob)
        {
            cout<<"Tie"<<endl;
        }
        else if(alice>bob)
        {
            cout<<"Alice"<<endl;
        }
        else
        {
            cout<<"Bob"<<endl;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}

```
