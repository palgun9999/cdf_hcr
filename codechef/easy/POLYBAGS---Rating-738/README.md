- The first line will contain an integer $T$ - number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first and only line of each test case contains an integer $N$ - the number of items bought by Chef.
### Output Format

For each test case, output the minimum number of polybags required.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$

    while(t--)
    {
        int n;
        cin>>n;
        int c=0;
        while(n>0)
        {
            c++;
            n-=10;
        }
        cout<<c<<endl;
