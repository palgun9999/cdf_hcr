## Problem

### Speed Limit Test

Alice is driving from her home to her office which is $A$ kilometers away and will take her $X$ hours to reach.
Bob is driving from his home to his office which is $B$ kilometers away and will take him $Y$ hours to reach.

Determine who is driving faster, else, if they are both driving at the same speed print `EQUAL`.

### Input Format
- The first line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing four integers $A,X,B,$ and $Y$, the distances and and the times taken by Alice and Bob respectively.
### Output Format

For each test case, if Alice is faster, print `ALICE`. Else if Bob is faster, print `BOB`. If both are equal, print `EQUAL`.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings `equal`, `equAL`, `EquAl`, and `EQUAL` will all be treated as identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq A,X,B,Y \leq 1000$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
20 6 20 5
10 3 20 6
9 1 1 1

```

```
Bob
Equal
Alice

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Since Bob travels the distance between his office and house in $5$ hours, whereas Alice travels the same distance of $20$ kms in $6$ hours, `BOB` is faster.

 **Test case $2$:**  Since Alice travels the distance of $10$ km between her office and house in $3$ hours and Bob travels a distance of $20$ km in $6$ hours, they have equal speeds.

 **Test case $3$:**  Since Alice travels the distance of $9$ km between her office and house in $1$ hour and Bob travels only a distance of $1$ km in the same time, `ALICE` is faster.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() 
{
    int t;
    cin>>t;
    while(t--)
    {
        float a,x,b,y;
        cin>>a>>x>>b>>y;
        if(a/x>b/y)
        {
            cout<<"Alice"<<endl;
        }
        else if(a/x==b/y)
        {
            cout<<"Equal"<<endl;
        }
        else
        {
            cout<<"Bob"<<endl;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}

```
