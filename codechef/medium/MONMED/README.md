## Problem

### Monotone Median

*This is the easy version of the problem. Here, $N$ is odd and you must construct a valid sequence of subarrays for $K = \frac{N+1}{2}$.
The setup of both problems is otherwise the same.*

You are given a permutation $P$ of length $N$, where $N$ is  **odd**.
A permutation of length $N$ is an array of length $N$ that contains every integer from $1$ to $N$ exactly once each.

Let $K = \frac{N+1}{2}$.
Find a sequence of $K$ subarrays $[L_1,R_1], [L_2,R_2], \ldots, [L_K,R_K]$ such that all the following conditions hold:

- For each $1 \le i \le K$, the length of $[L_i,R_i]$ is exactly $2i-1$. That is, $R_i-L_i+1=2i-1$.
- For each $2 \le i \le K$, the subarray $[L_i,R_i]$ contains $[L_{i-1},R_{i-1}]$. That is, $L_i \le L_{i-1}$ and $R_{i-1} \le R_i$.
- The medians of these $K$ subarrays are strictly increasing.

The median of an array of odd length is its middle element after sorting it. For example, the median of $[4,1,3]$ is $3$.

If many such sequences exist, you may find any of them.
If no such sequence exists, print $-1$.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of two lines of input. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$ — the length of the permutation. The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $P_1, \ldots, P_N$.
### Output Format

For each test case:

- If no valid sequence exists, print $-1$ on a new line.
- Otherwise, print $K=\frac{N+1}{2}$ lines. On the $i$-th line, print two space-separated integers $L_i$ and $R_i$, denoting the endpoints of the $i$-th subarray.

If there are multiple valid sequences, you may print any of them.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- $1 \le N \lt 2\cdot 10^5$
- $N$ is odd.
- $P$ is a permutation of $[1,N]$.
- The sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2\cdot 10^5$.

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  There's only a single subarray, and it satisfies the condition.

 **Test case $2$:**  We have $P = [2, 3, 1]$. Consider the sequence of subarrays $[1], [2, 3, 1]$. They satisfy the conditions, because:

- Their lengths are $1$ and $3$.
- The first subarray is contained in the second.
- Their medians are $1$ and $2$ in order, which is strictly increasing.

So, this is a valid sequence of subarrays.
We print the endpoints of the subarrays, which is $[3, 3]$ for $[1]$ and $[1, 3]$ for $[2, 3, 1]$.

 **Test case $3$:**  It can be verified that no valid sequence of subarrays satisfying the conditions exists.
