# Rightmost Different Bit

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given two integers  **m**  and  **n**, return the position (1-based from the right) of the rightmost bit where they differ in binary, or -1 if both are identical.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: m = 11, n = 9
Output: 2
Explanation: Binary representation of the given numbers are: 1011 and 1001, 2nd bit from right is different.
```

```
Input: m = 52, n = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: Binary representation of the given numbers are: 110100 and 0100, 5th-bit from right is different.

```

```
Input: m = 29, n = 15
Output: 2
Explanation: Binary representation of the given numbers are: 29 in binary is 11101, 15 in binary is 01111. The 2nd bit from the right is different.
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int posOfRightMostDiffBit(int m, int n) 
    {
        int x = m ^ n;
        if (x == 0)
        {
            return -1;
        }
        int pos = 1;
        while ((x & 1) == 0)
        {
            x >>= 1;
            pos++;
        }
        return pos;
    }
};
```
