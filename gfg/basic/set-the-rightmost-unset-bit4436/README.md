# Set the rightmost unset bit

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Given a non-negative number  **n**. The problem is to set the rightmost unset bit in the binary representation of  **n**.

 **Examples :** 

```
Input: n = 6
Output: 7
Explanation: The binary representation of 6 is 110. After setting right most bit it becomes 111 which is 7.
```

```
Input: n = 15
Output: 31
Explanation: The binary representation of 15 is 01111. After setting right most bit it becomes 11111 which is 31.
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ n ≤ 109

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    int setBit(int n) 
    {
        return n|(n+1);
    }
};
```
