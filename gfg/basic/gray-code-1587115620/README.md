# Binary To Gray Code Conversion

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Given a non-negative integer  **n**, convert its binary representation into the corresponding Gray code and return the decimal value of the resulting Gray code.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: n = 7
Output: 4
Explanation: The binary representation of 7 is 111. Its Gray code representation is 100, whose decimal value is 4.
```

```
Input: n = 10
Output: 15
Explanation: The binary representation of 10 is 1010. Its Gray code representation is 1111, whose decimal value is 15.
```

```
Input: n = 0
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 0 is 0. Its Gray code representation is also 0, whose decimal value is 0.
```

 **Constraints:** 
0 ≤ n ≤ 109

    int binaryToGray(int n) 
    {
        return n^(n>>1);
    }
};
```
