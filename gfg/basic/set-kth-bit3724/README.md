# Set kth Bit

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Given a number  **n**  and a value  **k**. From the right, set the kth bit in the binary representation of n. The position of the Least Significant Bit(or last bit) is 0, the second last bit is 1 and so on. 

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: n = 10, k = 2
Output: 14
Explanation: Binary representation of the given number 10 is: 1 0 1 0, number of bits in the binary reprsentation is 4. Thus 2nd bit from right is 0. The number after changing this bit to 1 is: 14(1 1 1 0).

```

```
Input: n = 15, k = 3
Output: 15
Explanation: The binary representation of the given number 15 is: 1 1 1 1, number of bits in the binary representation is 4. Thus 3rd bit from the right is 1. The number after changing this bit to 1 is 15(1 1 1 1).

```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ n ≤ 109
0 ≤ k < x, where x is the number of bits in the binary representation of n.

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    int setKthBit(int n, int k) 
    {
        return n|(1<<k);    
    }
};

```
