# Adjacent XOR Transformation

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Given an array  **arr[]** of size  **n,**   transform it according to the following rule:

- For every index i from 0 to n - 2, replace arr[i] with arr[i] XOR arr[i + 1].
- The last element has no next element, so it remains unchanged.

Return the resulting array after performing the transformation.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [10, 11, 1, 2, 3]
Output : [1, 10, 3, 1, 3]
Explanation:
At index 0, arr[0] xor arr[1] = 1.
At index 1, arr[1] xor arr[2] = 10.
At index 2, arr[2] xor arr[3] = 3.
At index 2, arr[3] xor arr[4] = 1.
At index 4, No element is left so, it will remain as
it is.
New Array will be [1, 10, 3, 1, 3].
```

```
Input: arr[] = [5, 9, 7, 6]
Output: [12, 14, 1, 6]
Explanation:
At index 0, arr[0] xor arr[1] = 12.
At index 1, arr[1] xor arr[2] = 14.
At index 2, arr[2] xor arr[3] = 1.
At index 3, No element is left So, it will remain as it is.
New Array will be [12, 14, 1, 6].
```

class Solution {
  public:
    vector<int> xorArray(vector<int>& arr) 
    {
        for(int i=0;i<arr.size()-1;i++)
        {
            arr[i]=arr[i]^arr[i+1];
        }
        return arr;
    }
};
```
